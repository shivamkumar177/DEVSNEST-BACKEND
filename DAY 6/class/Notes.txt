Event loop is an algorithm which handles Async nature of Javascript.
Javascript has call stack which works like a stack. It pushes code in stack and after it's excecution it pops it.
It also has queue 
when something is in queue, the event loop works and if the stack is empty it pushes the item from queue to stack for execution.
